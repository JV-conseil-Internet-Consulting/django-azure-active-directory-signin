# Code of Conduct

We value openness, as well as friendly and didactic discussions.

Decisions are made based on best judgement, technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests,
answering questions to help others on issues, improving the documentation, are
all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of
the Python Software Foundation :point_right: <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>.
